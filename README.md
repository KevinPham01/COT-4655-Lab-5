# Lab 5: Parks
## Overview
In this lab, I built a SwiftUI REST client using the National Parks Service API. This app allows me to explore national parks, filtered by state. By selecting a park, I can navigate to a detailed screen with comprehensive information, additional images, and a map showing the park's location.

Although SwiftUI presented some new challenges, my past experience with building REST clients in UIKit helped me tackle the app's structure and design. This project combined API integration and navigation techniques, allowing me to further enhance my SwiftUI development skills.

## Features
* View a list of parks fetched from the National Parks API.
* Tap a park to view detailed information, images, and a map of the park's location.

## What I Learned

* URLSession with async/await: Fetching data from APIs using the more modern and readable async/await approach.
* Data Display: Dynamically displaying data with SwiftUIâ€™s List and Grid for a responsive UI.
* AsyncImage: Efficiently loading and displaying images asynchronously.
* Navigation and Maps: Implementing navigation stacks for detailed views and integrating maps to show park locations.
