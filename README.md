## Lab 5: Parks
# Overview
In this lab, you'll develop a SwiftUI REST client backed by the National Parks Service API. This app allows users to explore national parks, conveniently filtered by state. 
By selecting a park, users can navigate to a detailed screen with more comprehensive information, additional images, and a map showcasing the park's location.
Although some SwiftUI implementation details may be new, your past experience building REST clients with UIKit will provide a strong foundation. 
So, lace up your hiking boots and get ready to hit the trail!

# Features
* View a list of parks fetched from the National Parks API.
* Tap a park to view detailed information, images, and a map of the park's location.

## What I Learned

* URLSession with async/await: Fetching data from APIs using the more modern and readable async/await approach.
* Data Display: Dynamically displaying data with SwiftUIâ€™s List and Grid for a responsive UI.
* AsyncImage: Efficiently loading and displaying images asynchronously.
* Navigation and Maps: Implementing navigation stacks for detailed views and integrating maps to show park locations.
